> Make him a representation of Austere Tan? Like either reincarnation cycle or like austere promised him the destruction of magic and thus made a deal with him?

Born in 97 ABM he grows up with some magic potential but doesn't take to much mind in it as he has his affinity with technology to help hide some of his magic from his parents. 
Along comes a sister and they grow close as she grows up. She also has an affinity to magic but in a more wild sense.
It all comes crashing down when she shows him a new magic trick which when it goes awry ends up doing more destruction than anticipated. Causing their family home to be destroyed and Adam with rage against the magic that consumed his family. 

Using his tech he was able to forge a new prosthetic arm and with his charisma rose to power.

The stem of the hatred of magic is that a construct created with magic and tech killed his sister.

Has a daughter named Silvie.
