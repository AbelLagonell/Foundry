[[From Gotham to Manufacturing Warehouse]]:
In this area Killian is on the side of not wanting to be there. Only so many ppl will talk to him and many just look away. Killian is aware of this fact but tries to hide it. He believes the reason for this is because of his business practices and his connections. Rumors go around that he's a dirty man that you shouldn't get involved with.
Only ppl that come up to him are new arrivals (kids and immigrants) but as soon as they go back to what they were doing they got told of the rumors and thus he gets shunned again. 

Killian is really just one of the few ppl that survived when they first opened this pathway. He was there with the first party that cleared this area but after one by one they started falling, the remainder started to get resentful at each other. More and more time passed and more and more the rumors got more potent. until a point where Killian said, "There ain't no way I'm letting this get to my head. Let them believe what they want." And thus he let the rumors fester until he was the only one that really stayed to clean up. After that many ppl moved in the dungeon that was formed and with that there was an aura as he came into the path that everyone could feel. So much hatred from what was his old friends now baked into the dungeon almost as if it bore hatred for him as well.
