A born around 850 BBM. 
Living a peaceful life in her town, with her family knowing magic they are living the equivalent of a middle class life in their city.

Her son, born around 825 BBM, always loved to play around with the magic his mother made.
Until one day when she stepped away, he started to use the magic that she was working on and through a freak accident died.

Distraught she vowed to find a way to reverse this accident.
In 752 BBM after prolonging her life with help from other mages she managed to bring back her son, but not in the way she thought.
She knew what she had to do, since this was not her son anymore, but was too weak to stop him.

She later died to the hands of her own son unable to curb the destruction that was about to happen.

She resurrects [[Vengspi (Mike)]].
