Robot Ky inspired

This robot is the head of the cult following in the [[Manufacturing Warehouse]] praising the will the he got after reaching out for his blade.
He right now is not at the his best still needing his sword as a cane and thus cannot take too much power in this dynamic. There is a vacuum for power and he is starting to take that to his advantage to gain his followers. First he is starting it with positivity talk and promising a better life to come for those affected with magic and for those who wish for death he has a place they can go for that as well.
