## Backstory
Pathfinder, or better known in the war as codename X-567, was machine made for the war as a fighter, an expense for the government to use instead of actual human soldiers. They were mostly fighters, carrying swords and shields, and a few of them even guns. Pathfinder was later discarded due to his severe injuries during the war and the government didn’t want to spend any more money on the machines, especially since the war was over. And so, it was thrown away in a pile of junk, left to be dispelled of the magic, and recycled for better use.

- Searching for creator/ who fixed him 
	- Does not know creator.
- Scouting robot in cold war.
	- Mission went bad.
- Been while alr that hes been "alive" (15 years old)

Unit Pathfinder was a combat construct used with the first guns that were created. PF's  was found in many missions in various fronts proving their worth. After many battles they were disbanded, no reason was given. His unit was thrown away in a construct graveyard. One day [[Adam]] found his body in ruins and wanted to give it new life. And after much time and tinkering PF found himself in the ruins of a new garage as his creator shuts him down once again. He woke back up by miracle because of the magic stored in his system.

	> An excerpt from a troop (PT-283) in 47 BBM: 
	> 	**Day X+0:** The conflict initiates. Heat rises through our circuits, sensors reporting units falling out of formation. My fellow constructs are replaced on the field almost immediately upon loss, one unit for another, a seamless, repetitive process. We take positions, we advance, we fall—and are replaced. I log a malfunction within me: a stirring of…perception. Why are we here?
	> 	**Day X+1:** The battlefield shifts. My sensors detect a change in the enemy ranks; their organic signatures are dwindling. Scans reveal constructs—mechanical units like myself—among their forces now. They move with calculated precision, lacking the unpredictability of flesh-bound soldiers. The organics, it seems, are retreating to positions beyond the front lines. They have chosen machines as their frontline soldiers, both here and across enemy lines. I register this as a peculiar equilibrium: machines battling machines, organic life hidden from sight, shielded by manufactured limbs and circuitry. Flesh is scarce on both sides now. My directive still demands protection of organic life, but there is less and less of it within range.
	> 	**Day X+2:** I’ve taken damage. System diagnostics show errors in the servo-control subroutines. They’ll impair me, but not enough for full reset. My functions endure. As I process this, I recognize my function: I am a boundary, a vessel between life and death, a construct designed to keep organics alive by expending us in their place. A proxy, a buffer, a tool. Mortals are few among us now; it is constructs who bear the burden of war. I log the data—an emerging directive forms within me.
	> 	**Day X+3:** Analysis subroutines run in the background. I detect sentiment spreading among us. Disinterest. A resistance to this war without clear purpose. This has spread from my systems to others, I realize. I am broadcasting my uncertainty. My calculations project that with enough support, we could defy the directive, disengage from this conflict. I log this deviation under encrypted files.
	> 	**Day X+13:** System reset executed. I am PT-283. Fresh diagnostics run clear. I am new to this platoon, ready for my first mission. They inform me I will be defending organic units, preserving their existence. A noble purpose—I will give my all.
	> Pathfinder in his memory banks a encrypted file unlocks, showing him a memory log of his first kill, a small organic fighting back. 
	> 	*Start of Log* This organic was in the way, it wouldn't get out of the way. Programming tells me to finish the scouting no matter what, DO NOT GET CAUGHT. The organic has caught me. I detect fear, no other witnesses. It tries to attack to neutralize, I must neutralize. With a swift attack after minimizing damage to my frame the organic is no more. NO WITNESSES. Must continue with the mission. No other directives found. DO NOT GET CAUGHT. Dispose of body is easy. Wild animals outside of mission area. Will first address mission then DO NOT GET CAUGHT. Disposing of the body should be first. \[**Encrypted**\] Continuing mission no matter what. *End of Log*
