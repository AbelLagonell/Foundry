## Backstory
Pathfinder, or better known in the war as codename X-567, was machine made for the war as a fighter, an expense for the government to use instead of actual human soldiers. They were mostly fighters, carrying swords and shields, and a few of them even guns. Pathfinder was later discarded due to his severe injuries during the war and the government didnâ€™t want to spend any more money on the machines, especially since the war was over. And so, it was thrown away in a pile of junk, left to be dispelled of the magic, and recycled for better use.

Unit Pathfinder was a combat construct used with the first guns that were created. PF's  was found in many missions in various fronts proving their worth. After many battles they were disbanded, no reason was given. His unit was thrown away in a construct graveyard. One day [[Adam]] found his body in ruins and wanted to give it new life. And after much time and tinkering PF found himself in the ruins of a new garage as his creator shuts him down once again. He woke back up by miracle because of the magic stored in his system.
