She's like an Avatar type character

Her first life was as the apprentice to [[Ailbhe Dubthach]]. During her time under Alibhe she learned a lot about life and the balance that is held within that. Unlike her Teacher, she did not seek to bring people back from dead just give them another chance. As time went on small amount of records were kept about her existence and thus not many know how involved she was with the infamous mage. The gods saw it fit to reward Veshrael with the very thing she was studying as a pity gift for what her teacher plagued upon her.

> Like does Alibhe resent Vesh or is more of a im so sorry for your fate kind of feeling

Her other notable role was of the phylactery of [[Austere Tan]]. She was chosen for this position for the closeness she had to Austere. With her being a reincarnated being Austere sought her out when wanting eternal life. At first he was sweet to her building a bond but as he got closer to his goal his thorns became more and more visible. He prolonged her life to learn more and more about it until he got the idea to tie her to him for all of time creating a a cycle of birth and death. With his soul tied to her's, he is always destined to come back in some way.
Her sibling `(Could be male or female)` was the hero that fought and defeated Austere but was too late for their sister. 
> She is the last phylactery as the hero would have had to destroy them all.
