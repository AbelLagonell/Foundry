## Backstory
Working for [[Adam]] in his corporation he was just a regular janitor not trying to get much attention just trying to make ends meet. Once cleaning up he crept upon papers that exposed that Adam was a magic user, going against magic users. Somehow Adam found out about this and set a bounty on his head. The bounty was made to look like an accident and once Bethany found out she went on a tirade to find out how to bring him back. After a couple of weeks she did it, but she did not realize the toll that it takes on someone and thus lost her corporeal form, such is the price of performing dark arts when inexperienced. The form that he took was malformed but useful enough to get through it.

[[Ailbhe Dubthach|Ailbhe]] saw that similarity with the mistake she made, so in order to make sure that history doesn't repeat itself she made sure to guide this undead for the foreseeable future.
## Mechanics
[[Ailbhe Dubthach|Ailbhe]] presents herself along his journey giving him guidance and stepping stones on his path. 
This comes in the form of spectral form that he can only see.
Baby Pheonix is [[Ailbhe Dubthach|Ailbhe]] keeping track of Vengspi as he goes along in his journey.
