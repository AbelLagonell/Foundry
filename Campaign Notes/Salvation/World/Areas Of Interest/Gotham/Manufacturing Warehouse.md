A place with very little security making it ideal for sneaky deals and such as weapons dealing and such

This place also connects to [[The In-Between]] causing it to be not just a haven for criminals but also for magic ppl alike.

This place manufactured many robots for the war and thus has semblance of the war in its many machinery
Although much of the machines to make robots are long since dead robots in various conditions still roam the place 
The Robots in the warehouse are not hostile and at a point want to die. Those that are there have been either hit by magic itself giving them some semblance of will or have been treated with some sort of magic thus causing their will to emerge

A small cult like following of an old robot, [[Fulminar]]. They praise their making as some divine will. All seems well right now as not too many are gathered around and its just an old robot telling some stories from his glory days.

There are also some artifacts of the war that can be sold for the money. These artifacts tell of a man who lost his daughter in the war and tried to fix her by making her into a robot, only for her to seek death as living with bare metal on the mind was agonizing.
