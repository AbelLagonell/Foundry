[[Manufacturing Warehouse]]
[[The In-Between]]

In this passage way many marks can be seen on the walls from monsters past. Many of the markings are from battles that occurred when clearing this place. 

Now this place is still not in the greatest shape but for those who know the route it is a small reminder that there is peace in the world. Many are here from families to lone adventurers all trying to make ends meet.

As you pass all the rooms of the dungeon you can tell that every room has a purpose. Most are rooms, some are used for farming, and other are used to train the new generation for magic.
