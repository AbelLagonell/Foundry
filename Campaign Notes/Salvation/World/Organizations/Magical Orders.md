# Emerald Elephant
This sect of magic users are lesser known than that of the other two.
They specialize in other naturalistic applications of magic, like voodoo magic.
Their sect are in [[The Wilds]] with their goal to preserve the balance of life and death, looking down on anything that would affect that balance.
They are willing to help those travelers in need.

They will not raise the dead or kill any creature.
They have limited amounts of technology as they see it as an encumbrance to the way that they engage with the environment. 
Since they do not have much technology, their society is mainly based on community betterment. Meaning when someone in the community has a problem or is need of service the community will help. Food is also not concerning for them as they use the wild's natural sources to alleviate their hunger.

They have chosen the separation by choice.
# Sun-stone Salamander
This sect of spell casters was the first to be made once the practice of magic began to be highly criticized. They are a save haven for anyone that are magic-sensitive.
They run the [[Setting#Sanctum Sanctorum|Sanctum Sanctorum]] throughout the cities.
Their goal is to expand the world of magic to what it once was by keeping up practices of old, making new traditions, and fighting against the hate that they received

They do not condone the practice of the dark arts.
They are not adverse to the use of technology but only some actually try and understand and enhance it.
The way to get into the sect is to be invited, anyone can invite but they stress the secrecy of the whole order.

The order has a council that determines what to do with people that are disruptive to the order and to the cause. 
They also have many locations across the world.
# Scarlet Serpent
This sect is a splinter of the [[#Sun-stone Salamander]] going into the darker arts of the magic.
They focus on necromancy among other dark spells and the people in there are also affiliated with darker entities of the universe as members of the sect.
They can be found spread apart in the [[Dungeons]] usually where they can find monsters as they can hide their practice there.
Their goals are less organized due to them being a separated sect and their members having more selfish goals. They generally work on the premise of give what you get.

One thing that they do have is a union for getting magical-representation when dealing with devils, demons, gods when getting magic. They are the most open to new members having mentors and such to help new users unlock the best of the magic that they have. When a larger group of them come together they can make sure that people with similar goals are able to work together to achieve them.

This sect is mainly outcasts, having while selfish desires most do not have ill-intentions. Those who have ill-intentions do not garner too much help from the general sect. People also come to this sect to gain magic knowledge quickly but not at the best quality.
