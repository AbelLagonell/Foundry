In the outskirts of [[The In-Between]] and [[The Underdark]] this sect finds itself closest to the actual solution for necromancy once again, but due to how it was going even they shun the actual use of it. 

[[Vengspi (Mike) | Benjamin]] and [[Bethany (Before Madness) | Bethany]] were part of this as researchers for this different types of dark magic, never stepping to close to the necromancy. Their job was to try to find ways to enable someone to break pacts with any particular thing. Such like pacts for Witches when they want to break it. They also researched how to break the bond between soul and object such that souls can be freed from their prison.

This sect is built in like a cult with religious leaders and as such there are hierarchies within the place basically being built like a school, with the headmaster and having different departments towards the different stuff in the actual group. 

Departments:
R&D - where Ben and Beth were
Cooks - Makes all the food for the sect and also teaches how to use the magic to make the food
Teachers - Teaching general knowledge of magic without restrictions 
Medics - Teaching and Applying various methods for healing someone, no matter the person
Fighters - Teaching self defense and in some cases how to use magic interwoven with this defense to 
	1. Escape without trace
	2. Defuse the situation
	3. Use the other's strengths to your advantage
	- Making sure to not use too much magic to kill someone as that brings bad reputation to the sect.
