The wilds are a beacon of unchanging nature in a world of that leaves it behind.
Cities and towns were unable to seep into these wilds because of the beasts, monstrosities, and feisty flora present. Cities just thought that it would be better to just fortify their defenses and invest in high speed over-ground transportation between the different cities.

There are no long term temples to be seen. Any that do appear throughout the wilds are made integrated with the nature around them trying not to disrupt anything.

The place is also monster infested. With the [[Magical Orders#Emerald Elephant|Emerald Elephants]] having an understanding with nature so that they can help travelers and live in peace.
