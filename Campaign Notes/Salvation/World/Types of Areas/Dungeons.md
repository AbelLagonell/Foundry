Types:
- Clear => inactive, Expeditions to clear the dungeon have been successful over time and the dungeon is now inhabitable
	- Abandoned => All settlements have been gone for the time being, no other monsters have been recorded
	- Fresh => Dungeon has been recently cleared but no settlement has started, no monsters should be active in this dungeon
	- Lively => Settlements have been thriving and an active settlement is there
- Infested => Partially Active, some expeditions have been made to clear the area but it is still dangerous to explore without caution as something is still in the dungeon.
- Packed => Active, dungeon has not been cleared out at all

Some of the Dungeons are connected to [[The Underdark]] and thus when a dungeon is lively these entrances are blocked off.
