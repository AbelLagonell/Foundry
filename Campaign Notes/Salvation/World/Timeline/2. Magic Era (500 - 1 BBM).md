The first Dragons where spotted during this time and while not dangerous at first it was a sign of things to change.

The creator of the first tech is dead, in place a magic user taking place of the creator of technology. Making it more famous than before, making it widespread.

People are starting to create weapons using the magic and tech. This mirrors the cold war :)

Another war starts this one more bloody than the last. Constructs are being used to minimize the bloodshed but to no avail. 
Tech is also not helping much as its just killing the other quicker. 

And the pivotal moment happens. The Boom heard across the world. Somehow magic more potent than before stops the war in its tracks, creating a crater and once again leaving magic unbalanced. From the depths of the world undead start to flood out, at the epicenter is [[Austere Tan]]
