## Notes
### General
Most have either Concussive (P/B) Damage, some have Modular Damage (P/B/S), little have only Piercing Damage
Most have Fatal trait
To be modern it could be either Repeating, 3 actions but only once the mag is out. Revolver could be Capacity 6 for anything that needs to be individually reloaded.
Conceal leads to gun being light
Martial seems to up the dice rolled compared to something similar in simple
Scatter is used for shotguns which are always martial
