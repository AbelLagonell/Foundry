# Important Rules
# Planned Encounters
They have a quest to "Talk to 3 different people to get outstanding debts"
	 Killian to pay back Ludo 
		 He needs to pay back for the magical tattoo maker
		 Killian has a big payment that he has to give Ludo but has yet to scrounge up the money
		 Players are then told that there is a big liar's dice game in the old manufacturing house and are told that he will get them the money by end of day. 
		 If the players are bold enough they can help him in various ways, telling him what others might have, or joining the game themselves.
		 In the warehouse various decrepit robots are found spouting things about the war. Some are only in pieces others are fully together begging to be put out of their misery.
		The party is first guided there by Killian and then left to their own devices as he starts up the game at midnight. The players can join or continue searching for anything of value. 
	Get to one of the apartments on the bad side of town for more Vengspi lore 
		(One of the tenants has not responded and they usually pay on time so Ludo is worried)
