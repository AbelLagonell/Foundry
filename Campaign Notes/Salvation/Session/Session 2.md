They have a quest to "Talk to 3 different people to get outstanding debts"
	 Killian to pay back Ludo 
		 He needs to pay back for the magical tattoo maker
		 Killian has a big payment that he has to give Ludo but has yet to scrounge up the money
		 Players are then told that there is a big liar's dice game in the old manufacturing house and are told that he will get them the money by end of day. 
		 If the players are bold enough they can help him in various ways, telling him what others might have, or joining the game themselves.
		 In the warehouse various decrepit robots are found spouting things about the war. Some are only in pieces others are fully together begging to be put out of their misery.
		The party is first guided there by Killian and then left to their own devices as he starts up the game at midnight. The players can join or continue searching for anything of value. 
	Get to one of the apartments on the bad side of town for more Vengspi lore 
		(One of the tenants has not responded and they usually pay on time so Ludo is worried)

# Recap
Characters started up the 3 part quest taking up first the longest quest.

Once they join up with [[Ludo]] for a quest their vision goes into black and white.

Quest 3:
	Went to the hospital and noticed the book that is there taking a note on the year that the dead slowed down getting buried and noticed the [[Veshrael (Ernesto)]] was on that book
	They then go to a vr station (Virtual Insanity)
	Finally they go to the library. Confronting ken after [[Kraf Ven Doku (Rik)]] goes into the cooking section and [[Pathfinder (Antoine)]] gets into the lore of the library. Ken was in the necromancy section and was scared shitless.
	TLDR Veshreal now knows [[Ailbhe Dubthach]] and has more of connection to [[Vengspi (Mike)]]. They connect over the shared acquaintance with Vengspi finding out that he is the second revision of the undead.

Pathfinder finds information about the war that he was a part of.
# Summary
The gang has gotten to  know [[The In-Between]] or something about the unknown and gotten surface lvel knowledge about killians tie to [[From Gotham to Manufacturing Warehouse]] in between. After that Killiian has no weighted dice but has a coin (do wtv with it) and is confident in his ability to win the liar's dice game. Kraf and Pathfinder find [[Fulminar]] and they only meet him not really getting anything else.
