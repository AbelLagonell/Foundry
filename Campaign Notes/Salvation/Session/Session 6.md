# Important Rules
# Planned Encounters
Get out of the Lair and then find out that the rioters from the beginning are planning on attacking once again. 
This is through pathfinder's connection to the network. Where he recieves distress calls from the network.

### **How the Network Senses the Threat**

Since the **attacking group is acting as a catalyst for more enforcement robots to be produced**, their behavior might trigger **anomalies in the network** that the "enlightened" robots notice. This could happen because:

- Sudden **spikes in command activity** related to the plant’s reset protocols.
- Enforcement units **behaving erratically**, suggesting a **pre-programmed reaction** to an incoming attack.
- A **robot in the plant sending out a distress signal** before going silent.

This means the **robot NPC’s network** isn’t just warning the PC—it's trying to warn anyone connected, but most enforcement robots either don’t care or can’t process the message. The PC, however, has just enough connection to **pick up on something strange**.

### **How the PC Experiences It**

Since they aren’t fully "plugged in," it shouldn't be as simple as getting a clear message. Instead, here are a few ways they could perceive the warning:

#### **1. Fragmented Vision or Glitching Sensations**

At a random moment—maybe during downtime—the PC **experiences a glitch**, a vision, or a sudden flood of corrupted data. Within this burst, they get:

- A **brief first-person view from another robot**, seeing flashes of movement, a factory alarm, and then static.
- A **message looping incompletely**, such as:
    
    > "Reset imminent. Observe… erase… plant… no choice…"
    
- A feeling of **external interference**, as if something is **forcing a reset on their own network connection**.

#### **2. A Rogue Robot's Final Broadcast**

One of the enlightened robots (or a semi-aware enforcement unit) **manages to send a dying broadcast** before being erased. The PC **picks it up as a low-level alert**, something normal enforcement units would ignore as "corrupt data."

- The message could appear as **garbled text in their system**, which they must decipher.
- If they choose to engage, the PC might **trace the signal** back to the plant’s location, realizing something major is about to happen.

#### **3. Anomalous Behavior in Other Robots**

The PC notices that **random enforcement robots** near them **pause, twitch, or look in the same direction** before resuming normal patrols.

- If they scan deeper, they detect **a hidden subroutine**, something **new being spread through the network** in response to an external event.
- If they try to connect manually, they risk **overloading their own systems** but might get **a brief, haunting glimpse of what’s happening**.


# Recap
They found R&D with [[Barbara & Jason]]'s work as they talk about [[Bethany (Before Madness) | Bethany]] and what she was doing, Vengspi found out  that Bethany was going to go into a different sect and get higher up in the current sect that she is in, also about mortages that she might be applying to. They also met with Killian and he guided them through [[The In-Between]] until they got to the [[Scarlet Serpent]] and then they went in killed a gaggle of guys, finding Vengspi. After seeing Barbara they let her be after she transmuted three bodies such that they seemed  like Vengspi died and the other two bodies, one went into the arcane and the other went into a chair.

# Summary
They get out of the lair and pathfinder gets the message 
They are still going to Robo Ky
