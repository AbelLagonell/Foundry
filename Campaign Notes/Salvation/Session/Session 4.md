The gang are told by [[Ludo]] the final place where they might want to check up on for the final part of the quest. 

The gang find the apartment first all things good setting off a silent alarm once they open the door to the apartment. Everything in the apartment is overrun with disrepair and one singular plant seemingly ageless.

As the players explore for more information they can explore the bedroom which shows signs of a simple life that Vengspi had might have had. Vengspi DOES NOT GET EXPLICITILY TOLD THAT ITS HIS WIFE. There are subtle references to this being an apartment that was by inhabited by two people that are trying to start over, leave their life behind. They find things like pictures on the wall and on the fridge. In the bedroom they seem to have a picturesque closet with it being somewhat divided. 

The door is marked with crime scene tape and the players are unable to get in because of a rune placed on the door. In the bedroom there seems to be a book on runes on the terms of life and time. Mainly one rune being similar to one of statis magic on the door.

Once the door is open you come to a scene of destruction. There is a singular glyph in the middle of the room with what seems to be an explosion to be set off from the middle. Windows on that part are broken and the immediate area around the glyph is charred apart from a outline of a woman. 
The room itself seems to be a study of the arcane kind. With many of the books that aren't destroyed being of the devilish kind. This study has books on the dark arts and how to utilize them. Along with first aid kits and cyber implants, ranging from fingers to bigger stuff like legs and the like. One of the cybernetic implants can be found logged at the wall, a right hand. 

After being in that room for a while everyone hears someone getting inside and as soon as that happens Ludo sensing danger and the completion of the quest transports everyone but Vengspi. 
Vengspi is incapitated in the form of outer control from the person that went into the apartment.

Ludo cannot transport people that are incapacitated or of right mind?


# Recap
The gang has gotten to  know [[The In-Between]] or something about the unknown and gotten surface level knowledge about [[Killian]]'s tie to [[From Gotham to Manufacturing Warehouse]] in between. After that Killiian has no weighted dice but has a coin (do wtv with it) and is confident in his ability to win the liar's dice game. Kraf and Pathfinder find [[Fulminar]] and they only meet him not really getting anything else.
# Summary
You guys did basically everything i had planned :)
Vengspi is taken to a prison for experimentation and the rest of the gang is at ludos finding out whether they should save him or leave him to die and take the rewards
