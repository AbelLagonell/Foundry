`The dream-memory
`Veshrael woke up in a strange place, bloodied and battered
`Before her were many figures, a seeming band of adventurers, someone who resembles her, potentially Veshrael’s sibling, and a hooded figure.
`Veshrael approaches the hooded figure and her sibling. As she does she witnesses her sibling stabbing the hooded figure, which causes Veshrael to bleed more, 
`Hooded figure looks at Vesh with glowing eyes and ends the dream-memory

The group knows 
`Most people remember the second world war. The second war made everyone turn away from magic due to one magic user using it for not good. The main thing about this war was that it used constructs and had a "boom" opening a path from the underworld and letting the dead come out. One group of adventurers went to stop the magic user, no one supposedly survived but leader killed magic user. The name of the magic user is Austere Tan`
