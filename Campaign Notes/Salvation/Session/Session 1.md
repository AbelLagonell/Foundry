		 Players can hound him and get the money the next session or if he gets half of the credits he'll give the players a discount whenever they want to buy [[Killian's Shop|tattoos]].
	Get to one of the apartments on the bad side of town for more Vengspi lore 
		(One of the tenants has not responded and they usually pay on time so Ludo is worried)
	Get one of the ppl lost around the city, there are three different places where he might be
		working in the cemetery, studying up in the library, or hanging around in the vr stalls
		This one is in the last place they check, and its just a student trying to learn necromancy,
		the kid loaned out a mirror that when put up to oneself can reveal their past lives. (Veshrael lore)

# Summary
Characters started up the 3 part quest taking up first the longest quest.

Once they join up with [[Ludo]] for a quest their vision goes into black and white.

Quest 3:
	Went to the hospital and noticed the book that is there taking a note on the year that the dead slowed down getting buried and noticed the [[Veshrael (Ernesto)]] was on that book
	They then go to a vr station (Virtual Insanity)
	Finally they go to the library. Confronting ken after [[Kraf Ven Doku (Rik)]] goes into the cooking section and [[Pathfinder (Antoine)]] gets into the lore of the library. Ken was in the necromancy section and was scared shitless.
		`Upon finding him he is looking at books on resurrection and necromancy and the book is written by Veshrael. Ken is scared shitless by our arrival and our request for the mirror, Veshrael touching the book causes her to burst into tears, she steps back. Ken talks about wanting to bring back his parents, which causes Veshrael to explode at him and steer him away from that path. He says the mirror is the only way to see his parents anymore, but Veshrael talks him out of the path of trying to bring them back. We take the mirror and start getting ready to leave. Vengspi picks up a book authored by Ailbhe and Veshrael, which causes Ailbhe to "manifest" and talk to both Vengspi and Veshrael, revealing that she is the Phoenix, and that she was given a curse/blessing by the gods for her actions of creating Vengspi, who is a 'newer model'. She also speaks to her apprentice Veshrael and explains why she lost her memories, showing her the "gift" in the form of a book she made, which contained too much knowledge and was sealed by the gods, and the book is in the possession of Kraf.`
	TLDR Veshreal now knows [[Ailbhe Dubthach]] and has more of connection to [[Vengspi (Mike)]]. They connect over the shared acquaintance with Vengspi finding out that he is the second revision of the undead.

Pathfinder finds information about the war that he was a part of.
